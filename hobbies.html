                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>Speaking on memories and some of the things that I have learned from my family, my grandfather was a great man with many wide and varying interests.
                    He was a very well respected general, a much-loved father and husband, and an active citizen. 
                    He always kept up with what was going on in the world and made sure to know every bit that he could to have a well-formed opinion. 
                    He placed his family above everything else and was always around to spend time with the ones that he loved.

                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>Everyone around town knew of 'The General' and even one restaurant went so far as to have a special button made up on their register just for him, 
                    which would give him a special 'general' discount. 
                    As for his hobbies, he was an avid learner and always had a book in his hand. 
                    He was incredibly knowledgeable of history and politics, specifically United States history. 
                    He would even go on to write three books: War Along the Bayous, Glory at a Gallop, and Bloody Hill: The Civil War Battle at Wilson's Creek.

                <p>
                    When he didn't have a book in his hand, he was usually relaxing at home with his wife (my grandmother), drinking a martini and fiddling around with computers. 
                    His grasp of new technology was somewhat lacking, but I have fond memories of running technical support for him when he needed it. 
                    He was also a fan of golf. While he wasn't very good, it made for a good excuse to get out of the house and go have some fun with friends.
